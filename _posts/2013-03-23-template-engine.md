When pregnant food cravings take on a whole new meaning.  If I trusted those cravings, I would have peanut butter for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, with an occasional helping of chocolate ganache cake.  Not surprisingly, I'm a little ahead of schedule on the amount of weight I'm supposed to gain.  So, I'm regaining control by writing an Android app to solve the problem.  It helps me plan all my recipes, servings, leftovers, and snacks; and then it emails me a plan for the week.  To generate the email's html, I used a template engine.

I'm familiar with .jsps, .cshtml, etc. for displaying dynamic content on a web-app, but I had never used a template engine to generate web content from a standard (non-web) application.  I chose a template engine called [MiniTemplator](http://www.source-code.biz/MiniTemplator/), which worked beautifully with Android.
